  <p>Search in CollecTF is fully customizable. Just select a taxonomic
    unit (e.g. the Vibrio genus), a transcription factor family or instance (e.g. LexA)
    and the set of experimental techniques that reported sites should be backed by and
    click Search.

  <p>
    CollecTF generates search and browse reports on the fly to provide
    maximum up-to-date information. This includes real-time alignment and logo
    generation. Reports for large taxonomical families or multiple TFs make take some
    time. Please be patient!
