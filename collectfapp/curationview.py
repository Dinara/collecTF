"""Handler class for curation process.

From Django docs:

Here's the basic workflow for how a user would use a wizard:

1) The user visits the first page of the wizard, fills in the form and submits it.
2) The server validates the data. If it's invalid, the form is displayed again,
with error messages. If it's valid, the server saves the current state of the
wizard in the backend and redirects to the next step.
3) Step 1  and 2 repeat, for every subsequent form in the wizard.
4) Once the user has submitted all the forms and all the data has been
validated, the wizard processes the data - saving it to the database, sending an
email, or whatever the application needs to do.
