Welcome to CollecTF's documentation!
====================================

CollecTF, a play on words using the French collectif [collective] and the acronym for
transcription factor [TF], is a database of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)
in the Bacteria domain.

CollecTF aims at becoming a reference, highly-accessed database by relying on its
ability to customize navigation and data extraction, its relevance to the community,
the quality and detail of the stored data and the up-to-date nature of the stored
information.
