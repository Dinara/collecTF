CollecTF (http://collectf.umbc.edu), a play on words using the French collectif
[collective] and the acronym for transcription factor [TF], is a database of
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the Bacteria domain.

CollecTF aims at becoming a reference, highly-accessed database by relying on its
ability to customize navigation and data extraction, its relevance to the community,
the quality and detail of the stored data and the up-to-date nature of the stored
information.

This documentation provides information about the database design and implementation
details. For more information about the database itself, visit
