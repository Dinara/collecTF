<p>
Search in CollecTF is fully customizable. Just select a taxonomic unit (e.g. the
Vibrio genus), a transcription factor family or instance (e.g. LexA) and the set of
experimental techniques that reported sites should be backed by and click Search.
</p>

<p>
Search results can be seen as individual reports (one report per TF/species) or as
ensemble reports (multiple TF/species). Click Export to access the data in machine
readable format.
</p>

<p>
CollecTF generates search and browse reports on the fly to provide maximum up-to-date
information. This includes real-time alignment and logo generation. Reports for large
taxonomical families or multiple TFs make take some time. Please be patient!
