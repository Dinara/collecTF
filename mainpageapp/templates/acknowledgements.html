CollecTF is based on the collective effort of a fantastic and highly motivated team
of dedicated curators without whom the database would be justâ€¦ well, empty. Check the
<a href="{% url dbstatsapp.views.curator_roster %}">curator roster</a> for kudos!

<p>
Integration with the NCBI RefSeq database is possible thanks to the dedicated effort
and infinite patience of Stacy Ciufo, Tatiana Tatusova and the RefSeq team at the
NCBI. Thanks for allowing us to put in our two cents!
</p>

<p>
CollecTF integrates data from and out-links to many outstanding resources, like the
NCBI Genome database and Wikipedia. Thanks all for their hard work.
