This directory contains all scripts that have been run for some small task
(e.g. DB schema changes, pulling some data from DB, etc.).

To run a script that requires DB access through Django models, one needs to
import necessary modules/settings, which can be troublesome. The way to run
scripts is to put the script in this directory, define a =run()= function inside
the file which will be run when the following command is executed.

#BEGIN_SRC
python manage.py runscript <script-filename>
#END_SRC
